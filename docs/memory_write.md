## memory_write arg1
- arg1: Page ID of the page to write to (a positive integer of 1000 or less)
- This command runs in user mode as a normal user command.
- If the page corresponding to arg1 is a page shared by the parent process, a Protection fault occurs and the system switches to kernel mode. A new frame is generated by the fault handler and allocated to physical memory. If there is no space to allocate in physical memory, the page is replaced by the page replacement algorithm in the same cycle as the protection fault handler is being processed.
- If the arg1 page is protected as ‘W’ permission, no protection fault occurs.
- If the arg1 page is protected as ‘R’ permission, protection fault occurs.
  - If the parent process calls this command: The protection fault handler changes the ‘R’ permission of both parent and child process to the ‘W’ permission. But, the fault handler doesn’t make a new frame because the frame is already handled by the parent process.
  - If the child process calls this command: The protection fault handler changes the ‘R’ permission of both parent and child process to the ‘W’ permission. Also, the protection fault handler copies the frame and newly allocate the frame, which is for the child process. Note that this new frame allocation is made only for the process which called this command, and if other child processes are sharing the same page, frame allocation for other child processes is not made during this process.
- If the page corresponding to arg1 is not allocated in physical memory, the page fault handler
will allocate it in physical memory. If necessary, the page is replaced using the page
replacement algorithm
